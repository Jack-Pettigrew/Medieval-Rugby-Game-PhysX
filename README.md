# Medieval Rugby PhysX Simulation

A University assessment dedicated to developing a Medieval Rugby physics simulation game. This project showcases just some of the many features the PhysX SDK has to offer; from Cloth simulation to Revolute Joints to Compound Shapes.

All non-static objects in the simulation have some form of physics being applied to them, for example, Cloth is simulating the effect of wind, obstacles are showing the use of joints, and some materials use physics based properties to simulate friction and restitution.

Features:
-Physics based Player + Enemy movement
-Physics based materials
-Cloth Simulation
-Revolute Joints
-Collision Filters and Triggers
-Compound Shapes
-Debug Info + Actions
